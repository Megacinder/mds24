You are invited to participate in it - if you have reached this point, then there is absolutely nothing left for this. Register on Kaggle and accept the competition rules. If you already have an answer for the test sample that you want to send for evaluation and get into the leaderboard, you need to add it to the .csv file and format it as necessary. To do this, in the data tab (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) there is an example of what this file should look like (“gender_submission.csv”). You can download and study it. For your convenience, below is the code that allows you to generate a file for sending."
