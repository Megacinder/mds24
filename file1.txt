Expenses of carriage? What can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants? Expenses of journeys?
What is the use of these trips, in the first place? Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts? There are no roads. Even the bridge between Durance and Ch√¢teau-Arnoux can barely support ox-teams. These priests are all thus, greedy and varicious. This man played the good priest when he first came. Now he does like the rest; he must have a carriage and a posting-chaise, he must have luxuries, like the bishops of the olden days.
Oh, all this priesthood! Things will not go well, M. le Comte, until the Emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals. Down with the Pope! [Matters were getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part, I am for Caesar alone.
