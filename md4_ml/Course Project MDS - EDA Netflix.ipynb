    "The coursework project is evaluated based on the team's oral defense (presentation) of their completed project before a committee. The committee is composed of course instructors, course assistants, and invited industry experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each defense, the committee assigns two types of grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first grade is for the overall project. It is given by the committee based on the depth of the team's exploration of the subject area, the complexity of the tools used in the project, and other aspects related to the content of the project's terms of reference. When assigning this grade, the committee refers to the criteria detailed below in the \"Project Evaluation Criteria\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second grade is the individual grade for each team member. This grade is subsequently recorded in the grade book. The individual grade for a team member is determined by the committee based on how well the member understands the completed project, how they respond to questions addressed personally to them by the committee, how their role in the project is evident, and other aspects related to the person's participation in the team's activities. The individual grade cannot exceed the team's overall project grade (the first grade). However, if the participant confidently and correctly answers all questions addressed to them, is well-versed in the material and content of the completed project, and their role in the team's work is unquestionable, then the individual grade becomes equal to the overall project grade (i.e., in an ideal case, the second grade equals the first grade).\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid subjectivity and/or bias in the evaluation by certain committee members towards specific teams, as well as any other manifestations of unequal conditions, the distribution of teams among the committees is done completely randomly using the Numpy library :) — the random seed is the date on which the distribution is performed, for example, `np.random.seed(28042025)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain the fairness and impartiality of the random distribution, any transfers of teams between committees (committee changes) are not allowed. Student attendance at the project defense is mandatory; a student's contribution without their presence is not evaluated and automatically equals zero. Additionally, having the camera turned on throughout the entire time in the conference during the project defense is mandatory."
